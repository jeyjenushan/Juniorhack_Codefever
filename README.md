# Juniorhack_Codefever

We are code fever team we are doing hostel management system for our junior hack competition. We created main four packages for our project such as Hostels, Student allocation ,Students and rooms. We created another package called Database management package to connect our database and do our database operations.

In Hostels package we created a interface named "Hostel operations" to use open close principle and we implement that interface in other classes. Our next package is student allocation we manage student operations using that package. Our next package is rooms we manage all the room operations in that package. Next package is Students we manage all the student details in student package.
